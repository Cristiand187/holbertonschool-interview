## :computer: Task

### [0. Sandpiles sum](./0-sandpiles.c)
Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles
 * Prototype: void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);
 * You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
 * A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
 * When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
 * grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable (See example)
 * Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
